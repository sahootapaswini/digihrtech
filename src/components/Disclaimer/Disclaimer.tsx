          The DHR Technology does not warrant: (1) that the services, any of the
          services’ functions or any content or software contained therein will
          be uninterrupted or error-free; (2) that defects will be corrected;
          (3) that the services or the servers hosting them are free of viruses
          or other harmful code; or (4) that the services or information
          available through the services will continue to be available. The DHR
          Technology disclaims any express or implied warranties, including,
          without limitation, noninfringement, merchantability, fitness for a
          particular purpose, and title. The services, including, without
          limitation, all content, software, and functions made available on or
          accessed through or sent from the services, are provided “as is,” “as
          available,” and “with all faults.”
        </p>

        <p>
          The DHR Technology will not be liable to you or anyone else for any
          loss or damages of any kind (including, without limitation, for any
          special, direct, indirect, incidental, exemplary, economic, punitive,
          or consequential damages) in connection with the services or your user
          submissions, even if foreseeable or even if one or more of the DHR
          Technology has been advised of the possibility of such damages
          (including, without limitation, whether caused in whole or in part by
          negligence, gross negligence, or otherwise, but excluding wilful
          misconduct) unless specified in writing. The DHR Technology’s
          liability in connection with the services or your user submissions for
          wilful misconduct will not exceed the amount paid by you to DHR
          Technology in the three months preceding the claim.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your access to and use of the services is at your risk. If you are
          dissatisfied with the services or any of the content, your sole and
          exclusive remedy is to discontinue accessing and using the services.
        </p>

        <p>
          You acknowledge and agree that if you incur any damages that arise out
          of the DHR Technology’s acts or omissions, the damages, if any, are
          not irreparable and are not sufficient to entitle you to an injunction
          or other equitable relief restricting exploitation of any website,
          property, product, program, television show, motion picture, or other
          audio/visual content owned or controlled by the DHR Technology,
          including without limitation the services (including those
          incorporating user submissions).
        </p>

        <p>
          You acknowledge that you may be waiving rights with respect to claims
          that are unknown or are unsuspected. Accordingly, you agree to waive
          the benefit of any law, including, to the extent applicable, that
          otherwise might limit your waiver of such claims.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties or
          the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so some of the above
          limitations and exclusions may not apply to you.
