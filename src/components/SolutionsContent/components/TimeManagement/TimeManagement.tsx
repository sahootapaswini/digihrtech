            The Time Management module within SAP SuccessFactors is a
            cloud-based application that provides capabilities across three
            areas: Time Sheet, Time Off, and Time Tracking.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Time Sheet application tracks all your employeesâ€™ working time,
            including holidays. Time Off is used to track time off requests,
            both on mobile and desktop, and includes a team absence calendar.
            Time Tracking provides your organization with several tools to
            improve and configure time management processes.
