          <p>
            SAP integration is the process companies use to connect their SAP
            systems to other systems throughout their organization. SAP data
            integration is a critical part of digital transformation. When
            businesses can effortlessly connect their data, applications, and
            systems across their landscape, they can speed up project delivery
            to boost organizational success.

            Effective People is uniquely positioned to support your cloud
            platform integration requirements, through leveraging our expertise
            within the SAP SuccessFactors suite, combined with our teamâ€™s
            technical competencies in developing standard SuccessFactors
            integration models based on the SuccessFactors APIs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on the principles defined in the SuccessFactors methodology,
            we have developed and refined our own Interface Build Approach, a
            delivery methodology that is constantly evolving through multiple
            project lifecycles.
