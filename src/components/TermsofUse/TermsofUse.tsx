          Please review these Terms carefully before using the Services. By

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>
          We may occasionally change these Terms, so we encourage you to review
          the Terms periodically. The most current version of the Terms (along
          with their effective date) will be linked from each of the Services.
          If you continue to use the Services after we change the Terms, you
          accept all changes.
        </p>

        <h2>Privacy Policy; Additional Terms</h2>
        <p>
          Our Privacy Policy describes our practices concerning data that you
          provide or that we may collect about you through the Services, and you
          consent to our use of data in compliance with the Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additional terms may apply to your use of the Services. We will
          provide these terms to you or post them on the Services to which they
          apply; they are incorporated by reference into these Terms. If there
          is a conflict between these Terms and any additional terms that apply
          to a particular Service, the additional terms will control.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sweepstakes, contests, and promotions on the Services may also have
          additional rules and eligibility requirements, such as certain age or
          geographic area restrictions, and you are responsible for complying
          with these rules and requirements.
        </p>

        <h2>Registration and Access Controls</h2>
        <p>
          You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login
          names and passwords and you accept responsibility for all activities,
          charges, and damages that occur under your account. If you have reason
          to believe that someone is using your account without your permission,
          you should contact us immediately. We will not be responsible for any
          loss or damage resulting from your failure to notify us of
          unauthorized use.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we request registration information from you, you must provide us
          with accurate and complete information and must update the information
          when it changes. You may not access any age-restricted Services unless
          you are above the required age.
        </p>

        <h2>Intellectual Property; License</h2>
        <p>
          The content, information, data, designs, code, and materials
          associated with the Services (“Content”) are protected by intellectual
          property and other laws. You must comply with all such laws and
          applicable copyright, trademark or other legal notices or
          restrictions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Subject to these Terms, you may access and use the Services only for
          your own personal, non-commercial use. We reserve all other rights to
          the Services and Content, and you may not otherwise copy, reproduce,
          distribute, publish, display, perform, or create derivative works of
          the Services or Content without our permission. You also may not
          transfer or sublicense this limited right to use the Services or
          resell the Services.
        </p>
        <h3>a. Viral Distribution</h3>
        <p>
          We may expressly authorize you to redistribute certain Content for
          personal, non-commercial use. We will identify the Content that you
          are authorized to redistribute and describe ways you may redistribute
          it. We may revoke this authorization at any time. If you redistribute
          Content, you must be able to edit or delete such publicly posted
          Content and you must edit or delete it promptly upon our request.
        </p>
        <h3>b. Commercial Licenses</h3>
        <p>
          You must obtain our written permission for commercial use of the
          Content or the Services. If you wish to license Content from the
          Services, please contact us.
        </p>

        <h2>Legal Complaints</h2>
        <p>
          DHR Technology respects intellectual property rights. If you believe
          that Content on the Services infringes your copyright, please follow
          our procedures for making a copyright infringement claim.
        </p>

        <h2>User Submissions</h2>
        <p>
          Some of the Services may allow you to submit or transmit audio, video,
          text, or other materials (collectively, “User Submissions”) to or
          through the Services. When you provide User Submissions, you grant to
          DHR Technology, its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, and partners a
          non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully sublicensable license to
          use, distribute, edit, display, archive, publish, sublicense, perform,
          reproduce, make available, transmit, broadcast, sell, translate, and
          create derivative works of those User Submissions, and your name,
          voice, likeness and other identifying information where part of a User
          Submission, in any form, media, software, or technology of any kind
          now known or developed in the future, including, without limitation,
          for developing, manufacturing, and marketing products. You hereby
          waive any moral rights you may have in your User Submissions.
        </p>
        <p>
          We respect your ownership of User Submissions. If you owned a User
          Submission before providing it to us, you will continue owning it
          after providing it to us, subject to any rights granted in the Terms
          and any access granted to others. If you delete a User Submission from
          the Services, our general license to that User Submission will end
          after a reasonable period of time required for the deletion to take
          full effect. However, the User Submission may still exist in our
          backup copies, which are not publicly available. If your User
          Submission is shared with third parties, those third parties may have
          retained copies of your User Submissions. In addition, if we made use
          of your User Submission before you deleted it, we will continue to
          have the right to make, duplicate, redistribute, and sublicense those
          pre-existing uses, even after you delete the User Submission.
          Terminating your account on a Service will not automatically delete
          your User Submissions.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may refuse or remove a User Submission without notice to you.
          However, we have no obligation to monitor User Submissions, and you
          agree that neither we nor our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates,
          employees, or agents will be liable for User Submissions or any loss
          or damage resulting from User Submissions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Except as provided in the Privacy Policy, we do not guarantee that
          User Submissions will be private, even if the User Submission is in a
          password-protected area. Accordingly, you should not provide User
          Submissions that you want protected from others.
        </p>
        <p>
          You represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant
          to DHR Technology the license above and that none of your User
          Submissions are defamatory, violate any rights of third parties
          (including intellectual property rights or rights of publicity or
          privacy), or violate applicable law.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Content</h2>
        <p>
          We occasionally provide third party content or link to third party
          websites on the Services. We do not necessarily endorse or evaluate
          third party content and websites, and we do not assume responsibility
          for third parties’ actions or omissions. You should review third
          parties’ terms of use and privacy policies before you use their
          services.
        </p>

        <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>
          The Services have been designed to present Content in a unique format
          and appearance. Unless we give you permission, you agree not to access
          the Services using any interface other than ours. We may deny
          permission to link to the Services for any reason in our sole
          discretion, and you must be able to edit or delete promptly links that
          you create, upon our request.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without limiting any other provision in these Terms, you may not use

            promotes violence, racial hatred, or terrorism, or that we deem, in
            our sole discretion, to be otherwise objectionable;
          </li>
          <li>

            potentially deprive us of revenue (including, without limitation,
            revenue from advertising, branding, or promotional activities);
          </li>
          <li>

            remove or alter intellectual property or other legal notices;
          </li>
          <li>

          <li>
            Engage in unauthorized spidering, “scraping,” or harvesting Content,
            contact or other personal information, or use any other unauthorized
            automated means to compile information;
          </li>
          <li>
            Impersonate any person or entity or otherwise misrepresent your
            affiliation or the origin of materials you transmit;

          <li>
            Defeat any access controls, access any portion of the Services that
            we have not authorized you to access (including password-protected
            areas), link to password-protected areas, attempt to access or use
            another user’s account or information, or allow anyone else to use
            your account or access credentials.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Site Access Account Deletion</h2>
        <p>
          We may take any of the following actions in our sole discretion at any
          time and for any reason without giving you prior notice:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Restrict or terminate your access to the Services;</li>
          <li>Change or discontinue the Services;</li>

            Deactivate your accounts and delete all related information and
            files in your accounts;

          <li>
            Provide information concerning you and your activities to comply
            with applicable laws or respond to court order, subpoenas, or other
            lawful requests, or if we believe doing so would protect your safety
            or that of another person or protect the security of the Services,
            or as otherwise described in the Privacy Policy.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We will not be liable to you or any third party for taking any of
          these actions and we will not be limited to the remedies above if you
          violate these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do not agree to these Terms, you should immediately stop using
          the Services. If you want to delete your account on a Service, please
          use contact instructions posted on the Service at which you obtained
          the account. Any User Submissions you made while using the Services
          will continue to be governed by Section 6 of these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sections 6 and 10-13 of these Terms will survive any termination of
          your access to the Services, whether we terminate your access or you
          voluntarily discontinue your use.
        </p>

        <h2>Indemnification</h2>
        <p>
          You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless DHR Technology, its
          parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, and the directors, officers,
          employees, shareholders, vendors, partners, contractors, agents,
          licensors or other representatives of each of them and all of their
          successors and assigns (collectively, the “DHR Technology”) with
          respect to all claims, costs (including attorney’s fees and costs),
          damages, liabilities, and expenses or obligations of any kind, arising
          out of or in connection with your use or misuse of the Services
          (including, without limitation use of your account, whether or not
          authorized by you, and claims arising from User Submissions). DHR
          Technology retains the right to assume the exclusive defence and
          control of any claim subject to indemnification, and in such cases you
          agree to cooperate with us to defend such claim.
        </p>

        <h2>Governing Law, Venue, and Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms and all claims arising from or related to your use of the
          Services will be governed by and construed in accordance with Indian
          laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration (as
          set forth below), you agree to exclusive jurisdiction in courts in
          India. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, we may seek
          injunctive or other equitable relief from any court of competent
          jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, you must file any
          claim or action related to use of the Services or these Terms within
          one year after such claim or action accrued. Otherwise, you will waive
          the claim or action.
        </p>

        <h2>Arbitration</h2>
        <p>
          We may elect to resolve any controversy or claim arising out of or
          relating to these Terms or the Services by binding arbitration in
          mutual understanding with the other parties. Unless we establish a
          different location, arbitration hearings will be held in India. The
          arbitrator’s award will be binding and may be entered as a judgment in
          any court of competent jurisdiction.
        </p>

        <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
        <p>
          We may be required by state or federal law to notify you of certain
          events. You hereby acknowledge and agree that such notices will be
          effective upon our posting them on our sites or delivering them to you
          via email. You may update your email address by visiting the Services
          where you have provided contact information. If you do not provide us
          with accurate information, we will not be responsible for failure to
          notify you. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision
          in these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or
          provision. These Terms, including all additional terms, conditions,
          and policies on the Services, constitute the entire agreement between
          you and us and supersede all prior agreements with respect to the
          subject matter hereof. If any part of these Terms is determined to be
          invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, that provision will be
          removed, and the remainder of the Terms will continue to be valid and
          enforceable.
